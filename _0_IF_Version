/*
This was exceptionally easy to convert from SQL to Python because CASE works extremely similarly to IF.
So much so, it felt like a copy-paste translation.
Given I do not have mountains of data to test the two against each other, I would guess the SQL version has a shorter runtime because that language is designed for set operations, but Python is famous for performing well, regardless of use-case.
To make it more fair, I should at least put a, b,and c in tuples.
